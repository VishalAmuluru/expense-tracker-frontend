Expense Tracker Frontend
Hi there! I'm Vishal Amuluru, and welcome to the Expense Tracker Frontend repository. This project is part of a larger expense tracker application that I built to help users keep an eye on their spending and manage their budgets with ease.

What It Does
This frontend application provides a clean and responsive interface where users can:

View their expenses: Check out a summary and detailed view of daily spending.
Manage budgets: Create and update budget plans, and see how your spending measures up.
User Authentication: Login and register securely to keep your data private.
Data Visualization: Enjoy visual charts that help you understand your spending habits.
Theming: Switch between light and dark modes for a comfortable viewing experience.
Built With
React: For building the user interface.
Vite: For a fast and modern development experience.
TypeScript: For adding strong typing and improving code reliability.
Styled Components: For writing CSS in JavaScript and theming.
Axios: For handling HTTP requests to the backend API.

Why I Built This
I created this project to demonstrate my ability to build modern, user-friendly web applications. The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, ensuring a great user experience whether you're on a desktop or mobile device. It also shows my skills in integrating with a backend service using best practices like Axios interceptors and a Vite proxy.
